CIS 422 entry survey

A survey that I give students at the beginning of the term. 

Work in progress ... lots of things that are ugly and not as they should be. 
Trying to move to (mostly) a YAML spec of survey questions, but parts are still
hard-coded in the template (poll.html) and in the flask app itself (special handling
of some fields). 

Currently appending to a text file.  I know that's terrible ... just not the highest
priority fix yet.
